# calculon
This is a very fast command line calculator that supports some advanced features, like functions and differential equations.

I pulled it out of my eispice simulator project and turned it into a stand-alone tool.

You will need the [lemon tokenizer](http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/) and the [re2 parser](http://re2c.org/) to build it.
